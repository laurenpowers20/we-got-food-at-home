# Title: We Got Food at Home

## 2023 Spring Hackathon hosted by General Assembly

A gamification app that incentivizes users to cook at home instead of ordering out. The app rewards users with points, badges, when they prepare meals at home. Users can input ingredients they have on hand and generate a recipe using OpenAI.

### Technologies used:

- React: used to build the user interface and handle the front-end development
- OpenAI API: integrated to provide recipe recommendations and ingredient suggestions based on user preferences and dietary restrictions
- Firebase: used as the back-end to store user data, manage authentication, and handle real-time updates

  ### Key achievements:

- Designed and developed a functional app within a 4 day hackathon timeframe.
- Implemented a complex algorithm that recommends recipes based on user preferences and dietary restrictions.
- Created a user-friendly interface that encourages engagement and repeat usage.

### Skills gained:

- Experience with front-end development using React
  Knowledge of integrating APIs and handling data with Firebase
- Understanding of gamification principles and user engagement strategies
